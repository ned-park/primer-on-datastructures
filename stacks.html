    <title>A Primer on Data Structures: Stacks</title>

    <h1>A primer on data structures: Stacks</h1>
    <h2></h2>
    <p>A <dfn id="def-validator">stack</dfn> is a collection of nodes, where connections and removals 
      happen from one end only.</p>  
    <p>That's a little bit abstract, so usually at this point lecturers start making parallels to pancakes or piles of plates.
      Those are fine to convey the idea of <em>last in first out</em>, but leave something to be desired when thinking about
      what a stack can do.  So I'm going to take a less culinary focused approach and ask you to imagine a single train track 
      with a dead end.  If you want to put things there, you can one at a time.  So the first one in is the furthest from the 
      exit, and the last one in is the closest.  In theory, the stretch of track could go on forever, but in practice it has 
      a finite amount of space it can store.  You could also think of it like beads threaded onto a string with a knot on one
      end if trains aren't your thing.  
    </p>
    <p>It's time to introduce a pointer to out Node class, because if you haven't already guessed each of our train cars is 
      represented by a Node.  Probably unlike real trains, these cars have a lot of hooks so can be tied to by many things 
      (though some of those hooks are in weird places so the effects might be unintended if they're used the wrong way), but 
      each has only a single chain that it can use to attach something else.  That chain is our pointer, and the hooks 
      spontaneously appear when something attaches to them and go away when that chain is broken.  It's a peculiar train by 
      modern standards, but it does the job.  The thing to remember here is that chains attaching from one train car to the next
      on the track are usually what you want, and chains that might attach to the train cars from off to the side are likely 
      to derail the operation.  
    </p>
    <p>I guess the last thing to say is that while a chain could be attached to anything, you probably only want to attach it to
      other train cars.  Just to recap train cars are Nodes, chains are pointers.
    </p>
    <h2>A new and improved Node</h2>
    <pre><code>
class Node {
  constructor(data=null, pointer=null) {
    this.data = data;
    this.pointer = pointer;
  }
}
    </code></pre>
    <p>The keen observer will notice that <code>this.pointer = pointer</code> is the only change between this
    new kind of Node and our <a href="nodes.html">previous Node</a>.  You probably remember that little bit of 
    strangeness when the data property contained another Node, which also contained another Node.  With this, and 
    all of the other datastructures our data property will just hold data.  That might be an Object, and while that
    could be a Node it almost certainly won't be.  That's because the pointer property in the Node is what will 
    store references to other Nodes.
    </p>
    <p>The idea of a pointer or reference throws some people off at first.  But you've been working with them 
      since you first began to program.  In JavaScript, we don't need to worry about the memory address directly,
      instead we just say that <code>a = 5</code> and when we need whatever <code>a</code> contains, we just use 
      it.  The same is true for the pointer, it's just that the thing the pointer stores is a Node (or null if 
      there is no Node that the pointer refers to).  
    </p>
    <h2>So how do Nodes make a stack?</h2>
    <p>That's a good question.  Remember back to the definition of a data structure in the introduction?  Well 
      our Nodes are the values here, and to turn them into a Stack we need to define the operations on that data.  
      There are a few operations that Stacks need to have.  Push, for adding a Node to the Stack.  The other is 
      pop, for removing a node from the stack.  Peek is often included so that we can see the data in the end Node
      of the Stack.  I'll also add a length so we know how many things are in our stack--empty is also a popular 
      option, but since it's equivalent to <code>Stack.length === 0</code> I'll leave it for you to implement if 
      you'd like.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
class Stack {

  constructor() {
    this.end = undefined;
    this.length = 0;
  }

  // add to Stack
  push(value) {}

  // Examine the top of the Stack
  peek() {}

  // remove from Stack
  pop() {}

}
    </code></pre>
    <p>Together with our Node class, these operations define a Stack.  Now it's just a matter of implementing them.
      Fortunately that isn't too difficult.  I'll start with push, since it isn't possible to have a Stack if 
      values can't be added to it.  There are a few considerations for push.  The length needs to be incremented to 
      account for the new Node that's added.  What if our Stack is empty?  What if it already contains values?  
    </p>
    <pre><code>
push(value) {
  let node = new Node(value);
  
  // update the length
  this.length++;
  
  if (!this.end) {
    this.end = node;
    return;
  }

  node.pointer = this.end;
  this.end = node;
}
    </code></pre>
    <p>
      In both cases, we need a new Node with a data property of the value we're passing into push.  In 
      both cases, we also need to increase the length by one.  If the Stack is empty, then the new Node
      just becomes the top of our Stack.  On the other hand, if the Stack already contains Nodes, then 
      we need to make the new Node point to the current top before we point the top to the new Node.  First,
      the new node's pointer points to the current top, then we update the top of the Stack to point to the
      Node we just added.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that we can add values to the Stack, it makes sense to be able to look at the top one, so it's 
      time to implement peak.  The only tricky part here is what to return if the Stack is empty, fortunately
      the optional chaining operator <code>.?</code> makes that easy.  The length
      doesn't change either.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
push(value) {
  return this.end?.data;
}
    </code></pre>
    <p>Finally, we need to implement pop.  The length needs to decrease if and only if the stack is non-empty,
      we'll remove the top Node and update the end pointer to top's next--which might be null--and return 
      the cached value.   
    </p>
    <pre><code>
pop() {
  if (this.length === 0) {
    return undefined;
  }

  this.length--;
  const popped = this.end;
  this.end = popped.pointer;
  return popped.data;
}      
    </code></pre>
    <p>That's really all there is to a stack.  It's suprising how much you can do with something so simple.  
      From the call stack you see printed out when your code throws an error, reversing an array, making 
      recursive calls, or the shunting yard algorithm for parsing infex expressions of binary operators all 
      use Stacks.  Take the time to implement one if you aren't comfortable with it.  Then figure out how 
      a Stack can be used to reverse an array or take a look at implementing the shunting yard algorithm.
