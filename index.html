    <title>A Primer on Data Structures</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>A primer on data structures</h1>
    <h2>Prequisite stuff</h2>
    <p>I'm assuming that you know the basics of programming in JavaScript(or some other language).  I'm also assuming 
      that you're comfortable with classes and Objects.  It would help to be a little bit curious about things.  Some 
      of the ideas you'll find here are strange, it might be the first time you've encountered them in an abstract form.
      Have patience with yourself, ask questions, build and play with these ideas.  I think that programming should be 
      a little fun, and these are some of my favourite ideas to play with.  Play is the key here, not everything that 
      comes up in the examples will be a good idea or something that should be applied everywhere, but a part of 
      learning about datastructures is getting a sense of what not to do.  Explore these ideas and you'll find them 
      intuitive.
    </p>
    <p>A little bit of functional programming wouldn't hurt.  But if you don't know it, that's okay too.  I'll begin with the 
      simple things and build things step by step (mostly).  Some things may be a little strange, especially if you're fairly
      new to programming.  This may not be the fastest or the most direct way to learn these ideas, but it's a step-by-step 
      and, at least from my point of view, playful approach to the subject.
    </p>
    <h2>So what is a data structure anyway?</h2>
    <p>A <dfn id="def-validator">data structure</dfn> is a collection of values and operations that can be performed on them.</p>  
    <p>That's probably a little bit abstract, so lets break it down a bit.  Computers work with information.  Often we forget 
      that everything, including the programs we write end up as a series of 0s and 1s in the CPU and memory.  Yet somehow the 
      computer knows how to run those programs and handle that data.  In other words, there's a kind of organization going on
      in the circuits that let computers interpret and run the programs we write.  That hard work is already done for us.  We 
      just need to worry about the information we want our programs to store, access, and transform.  
    </p>
    <p>Anyone who has spent time programming is probably aware that there are better and worse ways to perform the same task.  
      An infinite number of ways.  Yet the vast majority of those ways will take a very long time to finish if they ever do.  
      Similarly, there are lots of ways to store that information, but lots of those ways leave a lot to be desired.  Data 
      structures let us store, retrieve, and process information efficiently.  That means our programs run faster, are more 
      responsive, take up fewer resources, and give users (and developers) a better experience.  
    </p>
    <h2>That sounds pretty good!  So what's the catch?</h2>
    <p>Good question!  There's some learning involved.  It won't always be easy either, a lot of these ideas are things 
      you've never thought about in a rigorous way before.  But many of them apply to things you do each and everyday already.
      Other times, they're similar to things that you might have played with as a kid.  So even if the going is hard, and it 
      sometimes will be, take the time to sit down and think about how these data structures would look if you were building
      them as physical structures in the world.  Draw them out if you want, build models, play with them, break them!  Don't 
      just read about them in their abstract form and think &quot;I don't understanding this, maybe these aren't for me.&quot;
      Remember that bit about things you do (or encounter) everyday?  You probably already know a lot more about them than you
      might think.
    </p>
    <h2>I'm intrigued, but not convinced.</h2>
    <p>Alright, there are a few more caveats and things that take some getting used to.  But those all make sense too, or they
      will once you learn to think about them a little differently than you might be right now.  Everything you'll find here 
      has an underlying logic.  If you'll permit me, I'll even say they have a structure that makes sense once you've spent some time 
      playing with it.  There is a little bit of math (that's the real catch you say, but I hope you'll see that you're better 
      at math than you think when you understand why things work rather than just applying them to problems directly) involved 
      in the analysis of these structures and their functions.  But I'll break that down and show each step along the way so 
      you have the tools you need.  I'll also provide some physical analogies to what's going on so even if you don't want to 
      learn the math you'll develop a little bit of intuition about what it means.  Or you can just memorize the results if you
      want to talk about it without bothering to learn why it works and that's okay too--though do play with the structures 
      themselves.  They start simple, so see just how far you can stretch them.
